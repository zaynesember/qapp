QAPP TO DO

- Readd unique value txt reports or think of a better way to do so
- Check for correct column ordering
- Vote totaller to not duplicate if there is a TOTAL `mode`
- Allow for similar rows but with different `mode`, `district`, `precinct`****
- Exclude "COUNTY TOTALS", "MACHINE COUNT" from duplicate check
- Avoid flagging "CIRCUIT COURT JUDGE", "APPEALS COURT JUDGE"
- Implement office mapping checks
- Implement county and states FIP mapping checks
- Implement checks against previous year's precinct project
- Not report comma separated empty lists under issue_values
- Fix issue_values and issue_row_numbers not being truncated (maybe the latter is actually fine as is?)
- Give GPT a state's output and ask it to note all the checks performed and then note whether they are present in QAPP
- Detect running mate appearing with presidential candidate (i.e. detect "AND", "&", " - ", "/")
- Check vote aggregation against known state total for at least president
- Autofit text to width in excel report




Duplicate cases we want to detect:

1. Exact duplicates
2. Exact duplicates EXCEPT `votes`
3. Rows with duplicate `precinct` values but different `county_fips` or `county_name` values
4. Rows with the same `candidate` but different `office` or `dataverse`
