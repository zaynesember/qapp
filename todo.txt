QAPP TO DO

- Readd unique value txt reports or think of a better way to do so
- Distinguish between empty values reported from the data (which should appear as <EMPTY>) from cells in the QA report that actually just don't have anything to report which should be left empty rather than have <EMPTY> within them
- Check for correct column ordering matching the Precinct Project README
- Vote totaller to not duplicate if there is a TOTAL `mode`
- Exclude "COUNTY TOTALS", "MACHINE COUNT" from duplicate check
- Implement office mapping checks
- Detect running mate appearing with presidential candidate (i.e. detect "AND", "&", " - ", "/")
- Autofit text to width in excel report




Duplicate cases we want to detect:

1. Exact duplicates
2. Exact duplicates EXCEPT `votes`
3. Rows with duplicate `precinct` values but different `county_fips` or `county_name` values
4. Rows with the same `candidate` but different `office` or `dataverse`
